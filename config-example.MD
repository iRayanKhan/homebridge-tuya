## Configurations
The configuration parameters to enable your devices would need to be added to `platforms` section of the Homebridge configuration file. Examples of device configs can be found on the [Supported Device Types](https://github.com/iRayanKhan/homebridge-tuya/wiki/Supported-Device-Types) page. Check out the [Common Problems](https://github.com/iRayanKhan/homebridge-tuya/wiki/Common-Problems) page for solutions or raise an issue if you face problems.
```json5
{
    ...
    "platforms": [
        ...
        /* The block you need to enable this plugin */
        {
            "platform": "TuyaLan",
            "discoverTimeout": 60000,
            "devices": [
                /* The block you need for each device */
                {
                    "name": "Hallway Light",
                    "type": "SimpleLight",
                    "manufacturer": "Cotify",
                    "model": "Smart Wifi Bulb Socket E26",
                    "id": "011233455677899abbcd",
                    "key": "0123456789abcdef"
                }
                /* End of the device definition block */ 
            ]
        }
        /* End of the block needed to enable this plugin */
    ]
    ...
}
```
#### Device parameters
* `name` (required) is anything you'd like to use to identify this device. You can always change the name from within the Home app.
* `type` (required) is a case-insensitive identifier that lets the plugin know how to handle your device. Find your device `type` on the [Supported Device Type List](https://github.com/iRayanKhan/homebridge-tuya/wiki/Supported-Device-Types) page.
* `manufacturer` and `model` are anything you like; the purpose of them is to help you identify the device.
* `id` (required) and `key` (required) are parameters for your device. If you don't have them, follow the steps found on the [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/iRayanKgan/homebridge-tuya/wiki/Setup-Instructions) page.
* `ip` needs to be added **_only_** if you face discovery issues. See [Common Problems](https://github.com/iRayanKhan/homebridge-tuya/wiki/Common-Problems) for more details.   

> To find out which `id` belongs to which device, open the Tuya Smart app and check the `Device Information` by tapping the configuration icon of your devices; it is almost always a tiny icon on the top-right.

#### Other parameters
* `discoverTimeout` (optional) is the time period (millisecond) the plugin should spend for device auto-discovery. If unspecified, the default value is 60000.
