## Supported Device Types

NOTE: this plugin (and all other Tuya plugins at the moment) does NOT support bluetooth devices connected via a BLE mesh gateway / hub. Follow [#164](https://github.com/iRayanKhan/homebridge-tuya/issues/164) or [this issue](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-homebridge/issues/119) for updates. As a workaround, you can create a Scene within Tuya / Smart Life app, e.g. "Close the curtains", and expose this scene to HomeKit via Tuya Web plugin, see [Adding Scenes](https://github.com/milo526/homebridge-tuya-web#add-all-scenes-to-homekit) for details. This will allow native Homekit automation and control of your hub-connected Tuya devices.
